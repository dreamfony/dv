  Scenario: Visit Moderation Dashboard
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "moderator" persona
    # TODO Moderation Dashboard page exists on /admin/dashboard but it should be moved to /moderation
    When I click "Moderation Dashboard" in the "Secondary Navigation" region
    # view: http://local.dv.com/admin/structure/views/view/manage_org_view_org_without_email
    Then I should see the text "Organisations without email"
    # view: http://local.dv.com/admin/structure/views/view/survey_moderation
    And I should see the text "Survey Moderation"
